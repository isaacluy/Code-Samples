# Code Samples

This repo contains some of the code that I have written in the past. These collection of project don't reflect my most recent work but it might still give you a glimpse into the way I write and organize code. My biggest projects (Scion, Toyota, TVO, Winter Olympics, etc.) cannot be posted here because of copyright issues.

On my website http://dev.isaacluy.com you can see an overview of my work.

I'll try to start uploading more awesome/newer code soon! =)
