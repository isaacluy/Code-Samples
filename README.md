# Code Samples

## Description:

This repo contains some (old) code that I have written in the past. This collection of projects don't reflect my most recent (or best) work but it might still give you a glimpse into the way I (used to) write and organize code.

On my website http://dev.isaacluy.com you can see an overview of my career.

I'll do my best to upload more recent code soon! =)

*My biggest projects (with John Deere, Scion, Toyota, CanadaHelps, TVO, Winter Olympics, etc.) are not included below because of copyright issues.*
