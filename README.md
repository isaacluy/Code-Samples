# Code Samples

This repo contains some of the code that I have written in the past. Mind you that most of this code is old and hasn't been updated recently. But it might still give you a glimpse into the way I write code and how I organize it. My biggest projects (Scion, Toyota, TVO, Winter Olympics, etc.) cannot be posted here because of copyright issues.

If you are considering me as a candidate for any future project, please contact me directly and ask for some newer code samples and I'll be happy to provide them. 

Or go to my website http://dev.isaacluy.com for an overview of my work.

I'll try to start uploading more awesome/newer code soon! =)
