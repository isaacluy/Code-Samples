# Worstrappers.com

This is a Wordpress Theme I created for [http://www.worstrappers.com]. This website is a video blog of some of the funniest videos about bad rappers. 

I created all the HTML, CSS and Javascript from a PSD file and then, using a Blank Theme created by Chris Coyier as a base, I ported all the code and created a custom WP Theme. Using PHP I was able to personalize some of the functionality and behavior of the theme too.

Technologies used: PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, HTML and CSS

Live project: [http://www.worstrappers.com]
