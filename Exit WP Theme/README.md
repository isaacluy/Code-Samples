# EXIT

This is a Wordpress Theme I created for [http://theexitshow.com]. This website was used to promote a theatre play produced by Guayoyo Creative Collective. 

I created all the HTML, CSS and Javascript from a PSD file and then, using a Blank Theme created by Chris Coyier as a base, I ported all the code and created a custom WP Theme. Using PHP I was able to personalize some of the functionality and behavior of the theme too.

Technologies used: PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, HTML and CSS

Live project: [http://theexitshow.com]
