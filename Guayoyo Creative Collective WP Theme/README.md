# Guayoyo Creative Collective

This is a Wordpress Theme I created for [http://guayoyo.ca]. This website is for a small theatre company that I founded and run with some close friends and family.

I created all the HTML, CSS and Javascript from a PSD file and then, using a Blank Theme created by Chris Coyier as a base, I ported all the code and created a custom WP Theme. Using PHP I was able to personalize some of the functionality and behavior of the theme too.

Technologies used: PHP, Wordpress, Javascript, HTML and CSS

Live project: [http://guayoyo.ca]
